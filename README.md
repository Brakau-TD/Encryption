# Encryption
This repo implements three encryption/decryption methods for educational purposes. Built around an abstract class, the child-classes are meant to give an insight into three classic algorithms.
By no means should these be used for actual encryption of important information, as they are weak by modern standards.
Have fun forking them and adding new algorithms.

Be kind and mindful
